# ModalButtomSheet-Kotlin
Iâ€™ve seen a lot of popular apps that are using this common UI pattern named Bottom Sheet: a card that slides up from the bottom and that is commonly used to show context related information or to perform actions (e.g. payment checkout process) making sure the user maintains the focus on the task at hand but still has some context.

This is a fully customizable Bottom Sheet Modal.
